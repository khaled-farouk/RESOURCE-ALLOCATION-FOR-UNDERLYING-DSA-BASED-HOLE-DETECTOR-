# RESOURCE-ALLOCATION-FOR-UNDERLYING-DSA-BASED-HOLE-DETECTOR-
abstract:
Since Cognitive radio (CR) has emerged as a promising solution to the problem of spectrum underutilization. In CR, spectrum sensing is a key feature. It enables the cognitive user or secondary user (SU) to detect spectrum holes and ensure non-interference to primary communication .a multi-objective algorithms is used to design efficient spectrum sensing and and power allocation techniques to maximize the throughputs and minimize the interferences of the network. DSA scheme based on MOS which performs integrated traffic of different types. The presented scheme maximizes the overall MOS through a reinforcement learning for a system where primary users coexist with secondary users accessing the same frequency band of interest Evolutionary algorithms (EA), like genetic algorithms (GA), are search-and-optimization techniques that work on a principle inspired by the natural evolution theory of Darwin. Inspired by models of adaptation in natural systems that combine the evolutionary adaptation of a population with individual learning within the lifetimes of its members which are the fittest.
